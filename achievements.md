================

SCSD has many ongoing and important goals, obligations and commitments that 
have always been and will continue to be priorities for the District.  These include, 
for example, ensuring that all schools are safe places for students and staff, that 
all students will be instructed in core curriculum (Math, Science, Language Arts, 
etc.), and the District is managed with financial prudence ensuring fiscal solvency 
and health. 

The District will aggressively pursue alternative sources of funding from 
foundations, individual and business donors, and other philanthropic 
organizations to financial support the innovative programs contained in this plan.
In order to expand and fulfill the Vision above, the District will focus on the 
following high leverage goals: 

**I. Align Curriculum and Instruction to a 21st Century Model of Learning**

**A.** Articulate and implement a coherent and innovative PK–8 curriculum 
founded on the Common Core and subject-specific standards (e.g. 
Next Generation Science Standards) while leveraging powerful 21st
century approaches to deepen and accelerate teaching and learning 
(e.g., blended learning, technology-infused project based learning, and 
design and innovation learning)

**B.** Align curriculum to emphasize new, effective practices in Whole Child, 
Common Core Standards, STEM, and health/wellness with an 
emphasis on formative rather than summative assessments.  Ensure 
that the requisite training/professional development and support and 
educational materials are used.  

**C.** Create greater emphasis on a relevant, real-world, global curriculum 
that builds extended learning experiences and choices/electives
(relevant to the Whole Child approach), including integrating 
environmental stewardship, equity and justice, and related topics into 
the curriculum and an expansion of physical, social, and emotional 
wellness programs.

**D.** Place greater emphasis on Project-Based Learning to focus on 
problem-solving, collaboration, critical-thinking, and time management 
skills, thus allowing greater student engagement and "ownership" of 
their own learning.  Additionally, students will have personalized 
learning plans that ignite their passions and adapt to their particular
learning styles and needs.  These personalized learning plans will be 
collaboratively designed among educators, parents, and the 
students and will outline individualized goals and measurements.

**E.** Continue and expand the District's emphasis on the arts, including 
vocal music, instrumental music, and visual and theater arts.

**F.** Implement a comprehensive, district-wide Technology Plan outlining 
learner outcomes and effective use of technology for teaching and 
learning, data collection and analysis, and district-wide operations. 

**G.** Experiment with “blurring the lines of time and place” on all campuses 
such that some students may experience a modified school day, 
outreach work in the community, and learn from first-hand resources 
(including expansion of SMART-E).  This may include the use of 
Blended Learning approaches, integration of "non-traditional" activities 
into the school day, a greater integration of community activities and 
resources into the learning process, and redefining the boundaries of 
"school."  In addition, the District shall experiment with the traditional 
"sorting" mechanism of students with the goal to focus on achievement 
and mastery rather than time spent on task.

**H.** Partner with a cogent set of support providers (parents, 
program/community partners, elective teachers, design schools,
subject matter experts working virtually, etc.) working with students in 
and out of school environments

**I.** Support learners across the continuum including those with 
exceptional needs on both ends of the learning spectrum such as 
those with accelerated learning needs and those requiring specialized 
intervention and differentiation.

**J.** Create new rubrics and measurements of student, school, and district 
success, including measuring Whole Child outcomes (e.g. physical 
wellness, character development, etc.); a practice for collaborative 
review, including self-review, and Authentic Assessment of student 
work; and a district-wide longitudinal data system and protocols to 
support collaborative and personal assessment of student 
performance.

**K.** Build internal mechanisms to allow for "rapid prototyping" of new 
approaches to quickly learn successes and failures, and use the 
measurement of such approaches to inform future strategies

**II. Align Human Capital to Support Staff as 21st Century Educators**

**A.** Pursue a path to more greatly professionalize the role of the educator 
by providing a greater level of autonomy, responsibility, and support  

**B.** Build a robust professional development ("PD") plan to provide all staff 
with ongoing professional development to support their ability to teach 
in new ways and with new, emerging tools, including PD related to 
Common Core. Emphasize Professional Learning Communities and 
build a culture of learning and embracing of change.

**C.** Create time for teachers to engage in professional learning and 
collaboration by developing programs and utilizing support staff (music, 
health educators/counselors, Librarians, Technology Associates, etc.) 
to work in teams

**D.** Build social-based forums for staff collaboration and learning

**E.** Expand the definition of "educator" to include larger community-based 
and worldwide resources, including parents, other community 
members, and experts from afar (through virtual connections) and 
integrate such resources into the curriculum.

**F.** Establish a new system of evaluation for all staff (e.g. teachers, 
administrators, classified staff, etc.) that is based on professional 
growth, coaching and mentoring.  Such a system will include multiple
measures, including feedback from peers, students, and parents, 
student performance, and robust and frequent subjective evaluations 
by qualified administrators and master/mentor teachers. The District 
recognizes that it will need to make a significant investment in 
resources to do such robust evaluations.

**G.** Create new system of career path, roles, and compensation that reflect 
the increased professionalism of our staff (including master teachers, 
mentors, coaches, resource specialists, etc.) and the modern 
requirements of the role, including adjusting work rules to match with 
reality of modern borderless environments.  Build an appropriate hiring 
plan with job requirements relevant for these new and changing roles.

**III. Build Learning Environments for all SCSD Schools that will Reflect, 
Support, and Sustain 21st Century Learners**

**A.** Meet timelines of Facility Master Plan to build new schools and update 
existing schools -- within the principles of sustainability -- with flexible 
learning and collaboration spaces for student and educators, including 
spaces that are for: (a) individual, (b) small group/large group, (c) 
indoor/outdoor, (d) whole campus use, and (e) collaboration work

**B.** Establish learning spaces as sustainable and natural environments

**C.** Ensure spaces have robust technology infrastructure and flexibility for 
future growth and technological developments.  Such infrastructure 
shall provide capacity for one-to-one computing, a platform for district-
wide collaboration and sharing, and sufficient training for staff, students 
and parents in its use.

**D.** Build spaces and develop other programs (e.g. transportation) to 
minimize traffic flow and improve student safety

**E.** Involve each school’s staff, students, and community in the design of 
these new environments

**F.** Secure additional sources of funds above Measure H bonds to support 
more comprehensive parts of the Facility Master Plan, including from 
grants, donations, matching funds, etc.
