Measurement and Communication
=============================

The District will develop measures to monitor and support its continuous 
improvement in implementing the Strategic Plan and its programs and systems 
toward student learning. This will include data analysis and engagement of all 
constituencies.  The District acknowledges that a communications plan must be 
outlined and implemented to ensure that all staff and parents are informed and 
educated on both the Strategic Plan as well as progress made toward its 
objectives as well as to receive relevant feedback from all constituents.
Communication shall be ongoing, integrated and disseminated broadly such that 
school and district leadership can both communicate plans and monitor progress 
for accountability.

Annually, each school site will develop goals as part of their Single Plan for 
Student Achievement (SPSA) which will outline campus actions to improve 
student outcomes aligned with the Districtâ€™s strategic plan. In addition, parent and 
student input will be solicited as to how we are succeeding in meeting our goals 
at a site and student level.  Each summer, the governing board and district 
administrative council members will undertake a review of collected data in order 
to monitor progress in achieving intended outcomes.

Measures for monitoring progress of this Strategic Plan included, but are not 
limited to, the following:

**STUDENT**
* Solicit student input regarding their experience in 21st Century Learning 
environments and Whole Child development
* Create portfolios of Authentic Assessments, including but not limited to 
standardized testing information & selected exemplary work products
subject to longitudinal review
* Establish exit criteria for 3rd, 5th and 8th grade and review achievements of 
students against the criteria

**STAFF**

comprehensive tools and undertake longitudinal review of student work

environment, health and wellness, etc.
* Establish and annually review processes for evaluation, training,
