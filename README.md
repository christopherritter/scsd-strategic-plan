SCSD Strategic Plan
===================

**San Carlos School District Strategic Plan 2013-2018**

The following Strategic Plan outlines the vision, strategy, direction and goals of 
the San Carlos School District ("SCSD" or the "District") and was created over a 
period of two years in collaboration with District staff and community members.
While this plan is intended to serve as a guide for the District over the next five 
years, it is also intended to be an evolving, living document, and so will be 
reviewed and updated annually, as appropriate. This Strategic Plan was adopted 
on June 20, 2013.
