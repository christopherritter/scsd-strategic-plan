Implications for Teaching and Learning
======================================

The implications of these trends for education are far-reaching and fundamentally 
"game changing".  Although technology advances have catalyzed many of the 
above shifts, adding more technology into a 19th Century classroom does not in 
and of itself make a 21st Century learning experience.  Rather, it is both the 
content of our curriculum and the process of teaching and learning that are 
shifting.  The design of the physical environment both inside and outside of 
“school” needs to support new approaches to teaching and learning. 
Developments in technology and social networking have given us the opportunity 
to create new forms of collaboration and communication systems to change the 
way educators, students, and community members interact.

We also must recognize that the availability of these technologies presents 
certain risks and challenges, such as the increasing potential to isolate people,
distractions from learning, as well as greater opportunities for making poor 
choices (e.g. cyber bullying). All of these have real implications on the 
development of basic social and communication skills, particularly for children. 
Schools must be cognizant of this and be encouraged to experiment with new 
approaches that are more aligned with research on brain science and innovative 
approaches to education, such as incorporating principles of gaming cognition 
and motivation theory, as well as innovative ways to support the healthy social-
emotional development of our children in a tech-centered society.  If anything, 
the ubiquity of technology and virtual interactions make more important a true 
21st Century Education that focuses on "life skills" such as teamwork, problem 
solving, confidence, taking initiative and being resilient.

Specifically, the Who, What, Where, When, and How of educational endeavors
will undergo a process of transformation, including:

* Who: Bringing together a team of educators, broadly defined, from the 
community and across the globe as well as challenging traditional 
"sorting" mechanism of students
* What: Emphasizing the Whole Child, focusing on the 5Cs of 21st Century 
skills outlined above, and embodying design and innovation thinking -
reinforced by and built upon the foundation of the Common Core 
Standards
* Where/When: Extending and redefining the school day, leveraging the 
exploding opportunities afforded by blended learning, and redefining the 
notion of the "classroom" and "school"
* How: Developing a project-based, technology-infused approach to 
teaching and learning, featuring real-world, meaningful design challenges, 
including a deep appreciation for and exploration of the creative 
expression found within the arts 

California's adoption of the Common Core Standards (CCS) brings these new 
elements of teaching and learning to the forefront and helps address the 
opportunities and challenges we currently face. CCS provides a more student-
centered approach to assessment and gives teachers, schools, and the District a 
richer set of formative data to inform teaching and learning, while allowing 
students to self-monitor their progress in real time.  Student collaborative and 
conversational skills cannot simply be practiced as teaching strategies but 
instead need to be second nature to our students, as they participate fully in this 
new academic experience.
