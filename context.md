================

We are at a watershed moment in the history of public education. Nineteenth 
century conditions no longer constrain when, where and how learning takes 
place or how we organize our systemâ€”students, teachers, community members, 
facilities and resources.  Current changes and trends are not fads or temporary 
states.  If anything, their effects will magnify over time.  We have a unique 
opportunity and responsibility to address structural challenges in an educational
system that was designed for a very different time.  The District's status of having 
mostly charter schools allows it more flexibility to implement many of the changes 
envisioned in this plan, but it still must comply with many state and federal 
education mandates.

Additionally, this Strategic Plan is written in the context of political and economic 
factors as well as demographic and social trends.  As a Revenue Limit District,
SCSD is dependent upon the state of California for its funding, and given current 
trends in policy, it is likely that state funding for SCSD will remain modest with 
continued uncertainty.  As such, SCSD relies on local sources of funding, 
including monies raised by the San Carlos Educational Foundation (SCEF) as 
well as two parcel taxes currently in place, both of which would have to be
renewed over the next five years to maintain current levels of funding. In addition, 
SCSD relies on a very active, involved, and informed parent community to 
provide the educational experience for all children.  In addition, SCSD is a feeder 
district for the Sequoia Union High School District, and as such must continually 
work closely with the high schools to ensure smooth articulation of curriculum 
and transition for its students. 

SCSD has gained a reputation for excellent schools, and it believes that adoption 
of this plan will further raise the profile and performance of our schools. Our 
successes to date have resulted in continually increasing enrollment (as many 
young families move to San Carlos in part based on this reputation), and it is 
expected that this trend will continue for at least the next five years.
