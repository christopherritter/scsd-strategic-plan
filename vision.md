A Vision for Our Children
=========================

The San Carlos School District shall provide an innovative and engaging learning 
experience that fosters the development of the Whole Child to ensure all 
students are well prepared for success in the 21st Century, as evidenced by:

* Reaching their highest academic, social, emotional, intellectual, and 
physical potential; and
* Becoming problem solvers, critical thinkers, risk-takers, designers, 
collaborators, and innovators; and
* Developing into contributing, empathic citizens and leaders who are 
responsible stewards of their world and care about equity and justice, 
both locally and worldwide.
