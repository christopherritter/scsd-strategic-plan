# GLOSSARY OF TERMS

**Authentic Assessment -** The measurement of intellectual accomplishments 
that are worthwhile, significant, and meaningful, as compared to multiple 
choice standardized tests. Authentic Assessment can be devised by the 
teacher, or in collaboration with the student by engaging student voice. When 
applying Authentic Assessment to student learning and achievement, a 
teacher applies criteria related to construction of knowledge, disciplined 
inquiry, and the value of achievement beyond the school.

**Blended and Personalized Learning –** An educational experience that 
combines effective virtual learning (often done at home in form of a video 
"lecture" or something similar) with a more robust and interactive experience 
with a qualified educator who can better personalize instruction and support 
for each student.  This is most effectively facilitated in a "one-to-one"
computing environment where every student has access to a mobile device to 
allow for individualized work using independent computing power and internet 
access.  Students learn through online delivery of content and instruction with 
some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace and at 
least in part at a supervised location away from home.

**Common Core State Standards (CCSS)** - A national education initiative to 
align state education standards.  CCSS was sponsored by the National 
Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers and 
adopted by 46 states, including California, which intends to implement CCSS
in 2014-2015.  Generally most educators are optimistic about CCSS as it
offers a robust and real world curriculum that aligns with the District's vision of 
providing learning experiences that promote the development of academics, 
problem solving and critical thinking skills necessary for success in a global 
world.

**Environmental Stewardship (Sustainability) -** Taking action to promote 
sustainability in our schools and community and delving into science-based 
health and environmental issues will positively impact the whole person and 
community over time. The District adopted a sustainability policy in February 
2013 [which can be viewed here](https://sancarlos.csbaagendaonline.net/cgibin/WebObjects/sancarloseAgenda.woa/files/MTM2NjQ3MzQ0Mzc3Mi9zYW5jYXJsb3NlQWdlbmRhLzE

**Facility Master Plan -** A plan adopted by the District in March 2013 to outline 
the plans for building and renovation of facilities throughout the District, 
including the building of two new 4th-5th grade schools. [The plan can be 
viewed here](http://www.sancarlos.k12.ca.us/wp-content/uploads/3-14-13-
FINAL-San-Carlos-School-District-FMP-_-LK-EDITS.pdf).

**Global Curriculum -** A curriculum that recognizes the interconnected nature 
of the world and focus on a greater understanding of world history, culture, 
foreign language, civics, and politics.  

**Health/Wellness -** Educating students on how to interact with the people 
around them and how to make well-informed decisions with regard to nutrition, 
physical fitness, interpersonal relations and conflict resolution, and social and 
emotional well-being leads to healthy and productive lives.

**Professional Learning Communities (PLC) -** An extended learning 
opportunity to foster collaborative learning among colleagues within a 
particular work environment or field. It is often used in schools as a way to 
organize teachers into working groups.

**Project-Based Learning -** Students learn by engaging in rigorous projects 
(usually in teams) that are carefully planned, managed, and assessed to help 
students learn key academic content, practice 21st Century skills, and create 
high-quality, authentic products and presentations.  Students are often the 
catalysts for project ideas and design.

**Single Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) -** A document that 
represents a school’s cycle of continuous improvement of student 
performance. The annual process of developing, reviewing, and updating the 
SPSA includes a comprehensive review of data and the development of 
actions necessary to achieve school goals. The plan also addresses funding 
and proposed expenditures related to state and federal categorical programs.

**STEM -** Students learn Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
in sequences that build upon each other and can be used with real-world 
applications and projects promoting creativity and innovation.

**Whole Child -** the notion that learning needs to go significantly beyond the 
traditional basic subjects and cover areas such as music and the arts (fine 
arts, theater, etc.); sustainability; physical, social, emotional wellness; 
leadership skills and community involvement; and communication and 
collaboration skills. Students are encouraged to examine their own thoughts 
and actions and be sensitive to others' feelings and needs. Within the context 
of guided activities and peer feedback, children acquire the tools to be 
successful within the interpersonal domain, as well as to develop personal 
resiliency and awareness in the intrapersonal domain.
